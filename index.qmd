I am an applied statistician and biomedical data scientist working at the intersection of *machine learning*, *computational omics*, and *population health*. My [research](https://boyi-guo.com/projects.html) concentrates on developing statistically rigorous and computationally scalable machine-learning methods, as well as open-source software, that integrates population-scale multi-omics data to uncover functional mechanisms that explain disease heterogeneity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently, I am a postdoctoral fellow in Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg of School of Public Health, mentored by Dr. [Stephanie Hicks](https://www.stephaniehicks.com/). I am open to opportunities that advance my scientific career, tentatively starting date in 2025 Summer.
