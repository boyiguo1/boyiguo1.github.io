![](img/researchBanner.png){fig-align="center"} My research concentrates on developing statistically rigorous and computationally scalable machine-learning methods, as well as open-source software, that integrates population-scale multi-omics data to uncover functional mechanisms that explain disease heterogeneity.

# Scalable machine learning models for precision medicine

Heterogeneous reaction to treatment or disease progression requires individualized medical decisions informed by data-driven evidence. Deeply embedded in the the biomedical data, the key to successful precision medicine requires timely advances in machine learning and artificial intellgent models that extracts insights from the complex and high-dimensional biomedical data.

I develop Bayesian statistical learning methods and scalable algorithms for high-dimensional data analysis, with the application to biomedical data that includes, but not limited to, population-level omics and clinical data. Specifically,
I introduced new Bayesian hierarchical models, following the spike-and-slab LASSO framework, to select important nonlinear signals for high-dimensional data and predict disease risk of continuous, binary, count and survival outcomes. To overcome computational burden of training Bayesian models, I develop novel optimization-based model-fitting algorithms to improve computational scalability, and open-source software to make the analysis accessible to everyone.

<!-- Scalable Bayesian hierarchical models to analyze high-dimensional microbiome data: Though enlightening human physiology, microbiome data poses significant analytic challenges, due to its sparse and high-dimensional nature. To analyze the complex microbiome data, we developed Bayesian hierarchical models to simultaneously investigate hundreds and thousands of microbes while rigorously controlling error rates and maintaining statistical power. To expedite the model fitting, we proposed computationally efficient optimization-based algorithms for the Bayesian models to improve scalability. During the methodology development, I led the benchmarking of the proposed methods against the state-of-the-art methods, designing and implementing numeric studies using synthetic data. -->

<!-- ### Open-source software -->

<!-- Scientific software development translating cutting-edge statistical models to open-access interfaces: High-quality open-access software is indispensable for quantitative analysis, providing data-driven evidence to scientific hypotheses. Furthermore, with growing concerns about reproducibility, scientific software improves the standard by providing a well-documented well-designed interface, greatly reducing the technical burdens of conducting complex analysis. Leveraging my previous training in software engineering, I designed and implemented cutting-edge high-dimensional models in the R programming platform, translating theoretical statistical frameworks to open-access software. The software were validated and tested using both synthetic and real-world data. The developed software has been maintained. -->

## Spatially-resolved genomics

The cortical layers of the human neocortex were classically defined by histological distinction of cell types according to size and shape. However, emerging single-cell and spatially-resolved transcriptomic technologies have facilitated the identification of molecularly defined cell populations and spatial domains that move beyond classic cell type definitions and cytoarchitectural boundaries. Assigning gene expression to distinct anatomical subdivisions and cell populations within the human brain improves the understanding of brain regions and how they contribute to brain disorders. I led the quantitative investigation of 30 Visium Samples and single-nucleus RNA seq collected from 19 brain samples, where integrative cell-cell communication identified FYN-EFNA5-EPHA5 signaling pathway associated with schizophrenia. I also developed a novel visualization framework that simultaneous display disparage variables following Gestalt principles, allowing to in situ visualize of differential expression across various spatial domains.

## The Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke

<!-- Collaborative research studying health disparity in stroke and co-morbidities among racial groups and geographic locations: Black Americans under age 75 were more than twice as likely to die from stroke than were non-Hispanic white Americans, while people who lived in the South had a 40 percent higher risk of dying from stroke than their counterparts in other parts of the United States. Understanding the cause of the disparity is imperative to effective interventions and policy change. We analyzed data collected in the national cohort study, the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS), to examine possible causal pathways and identify novel biomarkers to inform disease risk. I provided critical analytic support to medical doctors, epidemiologists and biologists. In the multi-center research group, I delivered talks and tutorials on reproducible analytic standards. -->
