## Vision Statement
> I aspire to become a collaborative methodologist who innovates quantitative analysis of biomedical data conceptually and methodologically. Persistent and sustaining efforts will be spent on understanding the limitation of available analytic tools and discovering remedies in a rigorous fashion. With growing influence, I wish, in the long term, I could contribute to the understanding and the improvement of health disparity, particularly relevant to but not limited to the AAPI community.

I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in [Biostatistics](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/departments/biostatistics) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). My primary research interest includes Bayesian methodology development in high-dimensional data analysis. My current work focuses on developing spike-and-slab models and fast computing algorithms for high-dimensional additive models. My previous efforts include developing integrative models using spike-and-slab priors, and individualized treatment recommendations for multivariate outcomes using random forest. Before joining the Ph.D. program at UAB, I received a Master's degree in Statistics, and two bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Statistics from [the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/).

I am a collaborative statistician by training. I work as a graduate research assistant for a national observational study, [the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) project](https://www.uab.edu/soph/regardsstudy/about). REGARDS studies risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and addresses the racial disparity in CVD. My primary responsibility is to provide advanced analytic supports for medical and epidemiology investigators. As a result, I have contributed to 11 manuscripts published in peer-reviewed journals and eight abstracts.

Besides research, I enjoy service work a lot. I served in leadership positions for various student organizations during my first four years of doctoral training at UAB. Among the achievements, I am most proud of the peer mentoring program in the Department of Biostatistics I started, eventually connecting 12 students with their mentors. Personally, I've been mentoring three doctoral students in Biostatistics and Epidemiology, providing them suggestions on navigating through grad school. I received multiple rewards as recognition for my service.

During the time away from school work, I enjoy cooking, outdoor, and playing guitar. I am a decent cook without any formal culinary training, thanks to my 12-year experience of independent living. Before the pandemic, I played basketball a lot. Since the pandemic, I've been spending more time playing guitar (at the intermediate level). My ultimate goal for my guitarist career is to jam in a Blues/funky blues band.
