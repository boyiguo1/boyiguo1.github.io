I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in [Biostatistics](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/departments/biostatistics) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). My primary research interest includes Bayesian methodology development in high-dimensional data analysis.  
My current work focuses on developing spike-and-slab models and fast computing algorithms for high-dimensional additive models. My previous efforts include developing integrative models using spike-and-slab priors, and individualized treatment recommendations for multivariate outcomes using random forest. Before joining the Ph.D. program at UAB, I received a Master's degree in Statistics, and two bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Statistics from [the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/).

I am a collaborative statistician by training. I work as a graduate research assistant for a national observational study, [the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) project](https://www.uab.edu/soph/regardsstudy/about). REGARDS studies risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and addresses the racial disparity in CVD. My primary responsibility is to provide advanced analytic supports for medical and epidemiology investigators. As a result, I have contributed to 11 manuscripts published in peer-reviewed journals and eight abstracts.

Besides research, I enjoy service work a lot. I served in leadership positions for various student organizations during my first four years of doctoral training at UAB. Among the achievements, I am most proud of the peer mentoring program in the Department of Biostatistics I started, eventually connecting 12 students with their mentors. Personally, I've been mentoring three doctoral students in Biostatistics and Epidemiology, providing them suggestions on navigating through grad school. I received multiple rewards as recognition for my service.

During the time away from school work, I enjoy cooking, outdoor, and playing guitar. I am a decent cook without any formal culinary training, thanks to my 12-year experience of independent living. Before the pandemic, I played basketball a lot. Since the pandemic, I've been spending more time playing guitar (at the intermediate level). My ultimate goal for my guitarist career is to jam in a Blues/funky blues band.
