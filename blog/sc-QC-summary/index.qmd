We will limit our review to only UMI-based technologies.

__Quality control steps for__

* Detection of empty droplets and doublets 

* Detecting Damaged cells

__What are some commonly used metrics to be used in QCs?__

* Mitochondria proportion. however this is complicated by the type of tissue it uses.
  * [@galow2021] "recommend omitting this parameter for scRNA-seq in cardiovascular applications whenever possible" on the basis of xxx


__What are some basic strategies to do QC?__

* Thresholding

* Data-driven

  * miQC [@hippen2021]
  * data-driven quality control (ddqc) [@subramanian2022biology]
  * SamgpleQC: [@macnair2023sampleqc]
  * Validrops [@kavaliauskaite2023automatic]
  * ? [@bishara2022machine]
  * singleCellTK [@hong2022comprehensive]



__What are some downstream impacts of removing the low quality cells or not?__

__Does quality controlling snRNA data following the same standard as scRNA data?__

__Processing cells coming and sequenced from different batches.__



__Should people look into gene expression data during QC step?__
