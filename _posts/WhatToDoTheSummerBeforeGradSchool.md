Recently, I received a lot of query from the incoming students to the Ph.D. students on how to prepare for the grad school between admission and school starts. The followings are some of my thoughts.

Before starting with my advice, I would like to congratulate you on getting in to a Ph.D. program. Regardless if you are in your dream program now, I want to say you worked hard, and give yourself a round of applause.

Last thing before starting my advice, I would make a disclaimer. My advice only reflects my personal experience, and likely does not generalize well to other discipline or people from other background. But I still have faith that some points in these advice would help you. And also, all my perspectives are based on my own career goal, which is staying in academia, and interest in semi-theoretical biostatistics. If you have different goals, I can give you other hints otherwise.
 
Advices start here: 
2.	Advices to how to prepare to start
a.	ENJOY YOUR SUMMER BREAK!!! You have worked hard to get to this step(, even if UAB is not your dream school). You should be proud of yourself, and reward yourself with some leisure time.
b.	Setting up a semi-detailed 3/4/5-year plan for yourself. Imagining what you would like to do after your graduation, and plan backwards. The more detail the plan is, the better. (You can share with me if you want)
c.	Go over the faulty list here to find a person/persons whose research interests align with yours if you have one
d.	(Optional) If you enjoy reading, you can actually find this book(Graduate Research : A Guide for Students in the Sciences) and read
e.	(Optional) Read papers that interests you (Brainstorm ideas for your dissertation)
3.	Comps(if you mean qualifying exam): considering you have a MS degree in statistics, the comp should not be very hard. But be respectful, spend part of your time preparing when you are taking it.
4.	Thesis advisors: any body here is super friendly and treat you as an adult, which I mean treat you well. So their research interests should be the thing you should really focus on. Do you have your research interest established?
