I just finished the biggest annual conference in statistics, Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM). Such annual national conferences are normally very busy and could be extremely overwhelming to junior people who don't have a lot of national conference experience. I recall the first time I attended JSM, I felt extremely terrible. I didn't know thing, about both the talks and the utility of the conference. Frankly speaking, I thought it would be a great networking experience to talk to the big names, which possibly can get me to a good grad school. (That was during the time I was applying for Ph.D. programs) I was completely wrong, at least about my personal capability of networking. Hence, by the time the conference ended that year, I thought it was a completely nightmare, and was complete traumatized. I missed the next 5 years' JSM until this year. In those 5 years, I turned to ENARs, which is a slightly smaller conference concentrating on biostatistics. This year, I had some work spare to present and decided to presented at JSM. Surprisingly, I had fun at the conference that I used to fear (not that extreme) even in the virtual form. I also imagine I could have more fun if it was in-person, besides its in Settle. With such drastic comparison, I would like to re-visit my nightmare experience and put the myself now in the old shoes to see what could I have done to improve my national conference experience. I hope this could help other junior graduate students to have better experience during their first national conference, and don't live the nightmare I had.

The rest of this blog is arranged in the order of preparation for conference and attending the conference. I mostly will offer help from the perspective that you are there merely as the audience, i.e. don't have the duty to give talks/chair sessions. At the end, I will talk about what you can do to involve in the conference more actively.

# Preparing for conferences as an audience

-   Do your research

    The most basic fact: you have to know about the conference to attend it. Hence, when entering your graduate program, ask your advisors, mentors and senior students, what conference there are in the field, when those are. Most professional conferences are annual and happen at the roughly same time of each year, so you can plan.

    From here on, we assume we have a conference of target and know we will participate it, either as someone who paid for the registration/admission/ticket or not. Most of conferences, particularly national ones, will not check for registration for the talks. I advice students to pay for registration of the conference as possible, since you could participate programs other than talks. Or at least you don't have to feel sneaky or inferior. There are many ways to pay for registration fee, most commonly discounted registration fee for students/student members, travel grant and scholarship of the conference, mentoring programs, sponsorship from your department, your mentor, your professor. Sponsorship could be tricky depending if you will present or not, but just ask everybody, shameless and relentlessly. Most faculties who have money would like to sponsor students to go to conferences. Back to the main topic, the bottom line is that you now know you will participate the conference.

    With a target conference, you need first to decide if you have something to present in your hand. Think about do you need to prepare an abstract or a mansucript? Do you have a reasonable timeline? Have a discussion with your advisor and see what suggestions she/he offer.

    Next part, know what program/ round table discussion / short course the conference offer. Professional conference normally have mentoring programs that offer a lot of perks: scholarships, free registration to the conference, 1-on-1 mentoring. It could benefit you more than financially. For programs, look out to those new researcher/junior participants mixer, those provides a lot of network oppurtunities. Sometimes, mentors will be with their mentees in those junior people mixers. Also you don't get a lot of pressure by attending the newbie mixers. There are also many professional development programs, either as recruiting events or company info sessions happeniing during the professional conferences, where you can get free food/swag and fast interview for your internship or next job. Lastly, the short courses are something you should be consider registering. First of all, you can use to learn a topic in a concentrated time instead of over a semester. Secondly, it is a great networking oppurtunities. You can at least connect with the instructor of the course, which is an expert on the topic. It is a great oppurtunity to build an external reputation for possible recommendation in the future if you made a good impression.

-   Know your aims

    I think this is the most important point to adjust among all. Set up a reasonable expectation for the conference is utterly important. However, what do I mean by reasonable is very individualized. I can not give you an example of reasonable expectation. However, I can provide you some rediculuous unreasonable example I had. For example, in my first conference expereience, I wanted to talk to several of the big names in the field I know. They will be extremely busy during the conference, mentoring their students, giving and attending talks, business, leadership meetings, catching up with personal friends. Besides, you are not the only one who want to talk to the big names. So as long as you are yet having a good understanding of their research, a good idea to propose, or established relationship. It is hard to catch up with many of them. In comparison, it would be fairly to ask for mentorship/ connection with a junior faculties. Also, some of them are right out of the school, and they understand you struggle better and willing to treat you as peer instead of students. That makes big difference. Also, another expectation that is reasonable is to understand every single talk you attend. It is just very unrealistic as a junior graduate student, particularly in the theoretical ones. One simple reason is that some talk have a very deceptive name. A good expectation I will encourage is low expectations. Just talk with one faculty in an external institution, make connections with students in other institution. Aim high, but start low.

-   Find your supporting network

    The first time I attended the national conference, I was sort of alone myself. I don't handle well and back then I dont communicate well (I was very shy and unsecure). I can't remember when my "friends" (The PhD student that more senior in the department but I don't know well.) coming or leaving the conference together, and I have to take greyhound back to school alone. So in advance, plan the travel, ask to travel with your classmates together. There are also many other ways, to form your support network, such as schedule meals with your old friends who are in the same field, somebody you meet during the conference, and most importantly, you advisors/mentors. Ask them if they can mentor you about conference during a meal, or if they can introduce you to other people. The key is be proactive. The least you can do is ask you department chair, if you can be responsible for planning a department happy hour during the conference. The reason why I particularly mentioned to ask to have a meal with your advisor and mentor is that to get to know them as person instead of idol. Particularly after couple drinks, they may tell you anecdotes about their first conference experience or grad school, which could be suppurisinly interesting. It is an amazing experience when you having drinks as friends, even though its not gonna happen to everyone. You need to read the room a little bit. particularaly the part of travel alone. Go ask a lab mate, or a old friend of yours. The least you can do is to ask to hang out with your advisor, telling she/he that if you can simply observe how she/he attend conference, at least the first day to ease in. There are many ways to find your supporting network. If you have friends

-   Sign up for mentoring programs\
    Most professional conferences offers mentoring programs. Mentoring program is a great place to know about the conference or you field in general. You will meet people who don't have deep grasp on how the society works and ask the questions that you don't have to be feeling emberassed to ask, since trust me somewhere in the room, somebody is bearing the exactly the same question as you are. Most importantly, you are gaining perspectives. Sometimes you may not encourter a range of questions yet, but those questions are waiting in front of your without letting you know. Your peers may be experiencing the problems and the answer to those questions can help you easily overcome your future hurdles.

    Some other perks of program include limited scholarship which will help you with your registration fees and traveling. Some mentoring program offers 1-on-1 mentoring, where you can meet a every established people in the field, where you can ask about expereince and also professional advancement oppurntunites.

-   Spend some money

-   Prepare you CV

# Attending the conference

-   Mental preparation
-   No shame, be brave
-   Ask, ask, ask
-   More than statistics (or whatever the discipline you are in)
-   Be flexible and HAVE FUN!

# Be a better presenter

-   Whats your problem?
-   Practice
-   Set time-stamp timer
-   Know your answers

These are my personal experience that I think you could do to optimize your national conference experience. However, consider how heterogeneous the word "junior graduate" could mean, you could skip some of these advices.
