However, it is not specifically designed to study the nestedness of clustering results for example bumping the apripri number of clusters from k=2 to k=3.\nTODO: why measureing nestedness is important. I believe measuring the nestedness of clustering results is important in multiple use cases.\nI think measureing the nestnedness is very important in multi-sample integration, specifically horizontal integration.\n\nFor example, if you have increased the K=2 to K=3, having such an index measuering the nestedness of clusters could be informative of\n\nSample-level QC: If one sample may be different from the rest of the samples and requires special attention.\n\nViolating the assumption about cell composition are the same across all samples.\n\nClustering stability: Indicator that the algorithms lack of stability\n\nThe toy example is when I studying PNN-SCZ project, I see that some individual samples cluster doesn‚Äôt emerge until k bump to extremely large number. And also, when bumping K from small number to large number, increasing K doesn‚Äôt necessarily bringing more meaningful spatial domains.\nHow to implement this Among the larger cluster (K=2) for example, finding all the paired data points within the clusters, The number of pairs that are no outside of the clusters. Mathematically, among \\(\\sum\\limits^k_{i=1}C^{n_{k=2,i}}_{2}\\) pairs, how many pairs such that the pair in \\(K=3\\) cluster results stays the same K=2 clusters.

However, emerging single-cell and spatially-resolved transcriptomic technologies have facilitated the identification of molecularly defined cell populations and spatial domains that move beyond classic cell type definitions and cytoarchitectural boundaries. Assigning gene expression to distinct anatomical subdivisions and cell populations within the human brain improves the understanding of brain regions and how they contribute to brain disorders. I led the quantitative investigation of 30 Visium Samples and single-nucleus RNA seq collected from 19 brain samples, where integrative cell-cell communication identified FYN-EFNA5-EPHA5 signaling pathway associated with schizophrenia.
