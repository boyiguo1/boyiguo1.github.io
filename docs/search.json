Specifically, I introduced new Bayesian hierarchical models, following the spike-and-slab LASSO framework, to select important nonlinear signals for high-dimensional data and predict disease risk of continuous, binary, count and survival outcomes. To overcome computational burden of training Bayesian models, I develop novel optimization-based model-fitting algorithms to improve computational scalability, and open-source software to make the analysis accessible to everyone.\n\n\nGuo B, Jaeger BC, Rahman AKMF, Long DL, Yi N.

    "text": "Spatially-resolved genomics\nThe cortical layers of the human neocortex were classically defined by histological distinction of cell types according to size and shape. However, emerging single-cell and spatially-resolved transcriptomic technologies have facilitated the identification of molecularly defined cell populations and spatial domains that move beyond classic cell type definitions and cytoarchitectural boundaries. Assigning gene expression to distinct anatomical subdivisions and cell populations within the human brain improves the understanding of brain regions and how they contribute to brain disorders. I led the quantitative investigation of 30 Visium Samples and single-nucleus RNA seq collected from 19 brain samples, where integrative cell-cell communication identified FYN-EFNA5-EPHA5 signaling pathway associated with schizophrenia. I also developed a novel visualization framework that simultaneous display disparage variables following Gestalt principles, allowing to in situ visualize of differential expression across various spatial domains.\n\nHuuki-Myers L, Spangler A, Eagles N, Montgomery KD, Kwon SH, Guo B, Grant-Peters M, Divecha HR, Tippani M, Sriworarat C, Nguyen AB, Ravichandran P, Tran MN, Seyedian A, Hyde TM, Kleinman JE, Battle A, Page SC, Ryten M, Hicks SC, Martinowich K, Collado-Torres L, Maynard KR.
