    "text": "Novel nonparametric models to estimate individualized treatment effects and disease risk using high-dimensional omics data: Heterogeneous reaction to treatment or disease progression requires individualized medical decisions informed by data-driven evidence, improving the outlook of precision medicine. Leveraging the complex omics data, e.g. microbiome or gene expression, we develop high-dimensional nonparametric models, including multivariate random forest and generalized additive models, to estimate individualized treatment effects and predict disease risks. These novel machine-learning models substantially reduce the analytic bias due to the parametric assumptions of existing methods and deliver easily interpretable evidence to inform decision-making and improve the understanding of disease etiology.

    "text": "REGARDS\nCollaborative research studying health disparity in stroke and co-morbidities among racial groups and geographic locations: Black Americans under age 75 were more than twice as likely to die from stroke than were non-Hispanic white Americans, while people who lived in the South had a 40 percent higher risk of dying from stroke than their counterparts in other parts of the United States. Understanding the cause of the disparity is imperative to effective interventions and policy change. We analyzed data collected in the national cohort study, the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS), to examine possible causal pathways and identify novel biomarkers to inform disease risk. I provided critical analytic support to medical doctors, epidemiologists and biologists. In the multi-center research group, I delivered talks and tutorials on reproducible analytic standards. a.
